                        One of the more popular holiday games, Secret Santa is a fun and easy way for a group of friends,
                        family members or co-workers to exchange gifts. A Secret Santa gift exchange can take place at a party
                        or with participants all over the world! <br />
                        The basic concept of the Secret Santa game is simple. All of the participants’ names are placed into a
                        hat, box, etc. and mixed up. Each person then chooses one name from the box, but doesn’t tell anyone
                        which name was picked. He/she is now responsible for buying a gift for the person selected.
